# Deep map

Intended for recording people's stories about places on the map.

## Backlog

1.  *Downsize photo files before upload*
2.	*Author can attach a sound file to a picture. Sound plays when picture is displayed full size.*
3.	*Author user can arrange the pictures attached to a place into a particular sequence.*
4.	*Right-click doesn't create a place. Instead, it pops up a menu "Add a place here."*
5.	*Lightbox: When a picture is displayed full size, click near the left or right edge of the picture changes to the previous or next picture in the place.*
6.	*Lightbox keyboard: Left and right arrow keys.*
7.	*In slide show mode, if there is a sound attached to a slide, the change to the next slide happens at the end of the sound file.*
8.	Start screen. On opening for the first time on a device/browser, user sees description of what the app and project are about, brief how-to, and guidance about what sorts of material are invited. Navigations to privacy statement, Span, etc. Not seen again unless you click the “?” button.
9.	Distinct editing/reading modes for notes. When you open a note, it’s in reading mode: The text appears without editing buttons, and in a shape no bigger than required. Photos are bigger thumbnails than at present. An Edit button takes you to something more like current editing box.
10.	View mode slideshow: In viewing mode, when the pictures are set as a slideshow, the show plays half-size under the text notes. Click to go full-screen.
11.	Slide show: When a picture is showing full size, it changes to the next picture in the place at regular intervals. Author of the place determines whether this happens, and whether the show repeats after the last picture. Viewing user can pause the changes.
12. Movie. Author can upload a movie to YouTube (selecting private or public), get the link, and add the link to a note. Viewing user can click the link and sees the movie viewer embedded in the app. ?Link is behind a static photo.
13.	Downsize existing photos.
14.	Auto sync Git-Azure
15.	Projects. Authors always work in the context of a project. Map points you add are always assigned to that project. The project is set by the URI: when you share the map with others, you send them a link that includes the project. On entering the bare URI without a project, you get to choose from current projects, or enter a new one.
16.	Lightbox: Swipe left/right on tablet/phone.
17.	First edit screen. When an author first adds a note or opens a note for editing, guidance appears about what types of content are acceptable. Caveats about copyright, particularly of photos; and about references to living persons. Doesn’t appear again unless you click the “?” on the edit screen.
18.	Facebook login not working
19.	Tag prompts. An author can select tags as at present, at any time during editing. On closing an edit, if there are no tags selected, a screen appears that invites the author to select tags. It includes detailed descriptions and examples of the kinds of content to which each applies. 
20.	Language. On start screen, user can choose preferred language. This affects tag names, prompts, help, tooltips. Doesn’t affect content entered by users. 
21.	Auto translation. User can click to see a machine translation of user content to their preferred language. [The translator APIs are quite easy to use!]
22.	Search. User can highlight points on map that contain words or phrases they type.
23.	Better help. Particularly around sign in.
24.	Multi-user contributions. One author can add material to a note started by another. Text contributions appear in rule-separated blocks, with author name at top. Authors can subsequently edit or delete their own contributions. 
25.	Distinguish source and author user. Source is the person telling the story; author is the user entering it.
26.	Map pin icon instead of the crosshair symbol. 
27.	?Map pin only for phones and tablets – use right-click/long click for PCs/Macs.
28.	Live update. Points entered or updated on one client appear within a minute or so on other clients.
30.	Offline buffer. [Sort of works already, but needs robustifying.] Material entered while not connected is stored until connection is restored.
31.	Offline tracking. Downloads neighbouring map tiles while connected so that in case of disconnection while walking around, the map still works.
32.	Connect places. Author can connect a set of places into a sequence. Readers can see those places highlighted or linked by lines. Use to define walking routes or link places where a person has lived.
33.	Agglomeration. Places can be connected into a group. All except one principal place appear are normally hidden; they appear only when you click the principal. Use for example to show the detailed locations within an area – eg different points around St David’s Cathedral.
