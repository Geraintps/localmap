# Deep map

Intended for recording people's stories about places on the map.

## Backlog

1.  *Downsize photo files before upload*
2.	*Author can attach a sound file to a picture. Sound plays when picture is displayed full size.*
3.	*Author user can arrange the pictures attached to a place into a particular sequence.*
4.	*Right-click doesn't create a place. Instead, it pops up a menu "Add a place here."*
5.	*Lightbox: When a picture is displayed full size, click near the left or right edge of the picture changes to the previous or next picture in the place.*
6.	*Lightbox keyboard: Left and right arrow keys.*
26.	*Map pin icon instead of the crosshair symbol.*
7.	*In slide show mode, if there is a sound attached to a slide, the change to the next slide happens at the end of the sound file.*
8.  *! OS map goes stale.*
8.  *Backup*
8.  *! Don't show email addresses, show names*
8.	*Start screen. On opening for the first time on a device/browser, user sees description of what the app and project are about, brief how-to. Navigations to privacy statement, Span, etc. Not seen again unless you click the “?” button.*
8. *Roles. Project has a designated set of admins who have write access to all items in the project. Superadmins have write access to everything.*
8.  *Link to place - so that you can share a specific place. Map opens with that place showing.*
8. Rotate pictures if necessary.
12. Movie. Author can upload a movie to YouTube (selecting private or public), get the link, and add the link to a note. Viewing user can click the link and sees the movie viewer embedded in the app. ?Link is behind a static photo. (Works after a fashion already. Put a link of the form https://youtu.be/... in the caption of a photo.)
20.	Language. On start screen, user can choose preferred language. This affects tag names, prompts, help, tooltips. Doesn’t affect content entered by users. 
8. New stuff report. Emailed to admins of a project. 
8. Highlight new items button for anyone.
11.	Slide show: When a picture is showing full size, it changes to the next picture in the place at 6s intervals; or if there is a sound clip with a picture, at the end of the clip. Show repeats by default, but sound clips don't play during a repeat. Viewing user can pause the changes by changing manually. User can restart a show, with clips.
9.	Distinct editing/reading modes for notes. When you open a note, it’s in reading mode: The text appears without editing buttons, and in a shape no bigger than required. Photos are bigger thumbnails than at present. An Edit button takes you to something more like current editing box.
10.	View mode slideshow: In viewing mode, when the pictures are set as a slideshow, the show plays half-size under the text notes. Click to go full-screen.
8. "Contact us about this item" button in view mode emails project admins.
8. Separate title field.
17.	Editing help / First edit screen. When an author first adds a note or opens a note for editing, guidance appears about what types of content are acceptable. Caveats about copyright, particularly of photos; and about references to living persons. Doesn’t appear again unless you click the “?” on the edit screen.
25.	Prompt author to attribute sources. Separate source field? 
24.	Multi-user contributions. One author can add material to a note started by another. Text contributions appear in rule-separated blocks, with author name at top. Authors can subsequently edit or delete their own contributions. 
13.	Downsize existing photos.
14.	Auto sync Git-Azure
41. Better UI for tags.
42. Key for tags.
14. Filter map to tag.
14. User-created tags.
15.	Projects. Authors always work in the context of a project. Map points you add are always assigned to that project. The project is set by the URI: when you share the map with others, you send them a link that includes the project. On entering the bare URI without a project, you get to choose from current projects, or enter a new one.
15. Tags are defined per project.
16.	Lightbox: Swipe left/right on tablet/phone.
18.	! Facebook login not working
19.	Tag prompts. An author can select tags as at present, at any time during editing. On closing an edit, if there are no tags selected, a screen appears that invites the author to select tags. It includes detailed descriptions and examples of the kinds of content to which each applies. 
21.	Auto translation. User can click to see a machine translation of user content to their preferred language. [The translator APIs are quite easy to use!]
22.	Search. User can highlight points on map that contain words or phrases they type.
27.	?Target only for phones and tablets – use right-click/long click for PCs/Macs.
28.	Live update. Points entered or updated on one client appear within a minute or so on other clients.
30.	Offline buffer. [Sort of works already, but needs robustifying.] Material entered while not connected is stored until connection is restored.
31.	Offline tracking. Downloads neighbouring map tiles while connected so that in case of disconnection while walking around, the map still works.
32.	Trails connect places. Author can connect a set of places into a sequence. Readers can see those places highlighted or linked by lines. Use to define a tour round the map; or a walking route; or link places where a person has lived.
33.	Agglomeration. Places can be connected into a group. All except one principal place appear are normally hidden; they appear only when you click the principal. Use for example to show the detailed locations within an area – eg different points around St David’s Cathedral.
34. Dynamic update - polling
35. Offline option - download map tiles
36. Tag media
37. Drone view - sync w drone movement
