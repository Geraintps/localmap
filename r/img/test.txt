“How on earth did you know that?” 

<br/>

On a Zoom call with a colleague a few weeks ago, I heard a familiar sound, and asked her if she knew she had swifts nesting under the eaves of her roof. 

<br/>

She had noticed birds flitting around outside her upstairs windows, but was unsure what they were. So how come I knew? 

<br/>

	Well — the short answer is the shrill “scree-scree” call of the swift, which I instantly recognised. Look up in the sky of a summer’s evening and you may hear the same distant shrieks from crescent-shaped birds circling high above you.
<br/>


The longer answer relates to my life-long love of bird watching. My parents and grandparents had bird feeders in their gardens for as long as I can remember. As a very young child, long before Peppa Pig was even a twinkle in her father’s eye, I learnt that patience and stillness were rewarded with bird sightings. And naturally, I wanted to know all about the different visitors.
<br/>


	In the early 1980s, my best friend Elizabeth Harvey and I both became members of the Young Ornithologists Club (the junior wing of the RSPB). We grew up in the urban sprawl of a new town, but my parents’ house was on the periphery so farmers’ fields and country lanes were a short cycle away (I had a Budgie bike; Liz had her brother’s handed-down Raleigh Griffin). 
<br/>


Our bible was the Hamlyn Guide to Birds of Britain and Europe, a prized gem from a second-hand bookshop. The birds on the front cover were impossibly exotic and colourful. To this day, I have only ever seen a bee-eater in India. But with patience, sharp eyes and the whole of the summer holidays stretching out in front of you, it’s amazing how many birds you can identify — even in an urban setting. 
<br/>


We soon learnt the difference between a blackbird and a starling; a song thrush and a mistle thrush; a blue tit and a great tit (see info box below). Away from the garden, a thrilling spot would be the gravity-defying hover of a kestrel, or the electric-blue flash of a jay’s wing. 
<br/>


Under lockdown, many more of us are learning to appreciate the seeming renaissance of urban birdlife. We’re much more aware of birdsong now that traffic and aircraft noise is subdued. Locked down in our local neighbourhoods, curiosity can easily be sparked by noticing birdlife on an outdoor walk around a park or cemetery or (for the lucky ones) sitting in the garden.
<br/>

	There may be greater awareness and interest in birdlife under lockdown, but the BBC's recent Springwatch series showed mounting evidence that wildlife of all kinds is thriving. Certainly, the spots I've made in local parks and wild places this spring and summer have been the best in years. Is this because I have more time to look, or are the birds bolder and more plentiful? And how can we learn more about them?
